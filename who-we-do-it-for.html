      <h2>Who we Serve</h2>
      <p>The Africa Golf Foundation offers a variety of services to support individuals in the golfing community, and can be described as follows:</p>
    </div>
      <div class="who-we-serve-item">
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-lg-6">
            <div class="content-right">
              <h2>On the Course</h2>
              <p>We provide support for every individual who sets foot on the golf course from seasoned players to aspiring players, and from coaches shaping future champions to current and aspiring caddies guiding players around the course. Our commitment extends to the unsung heroes who work tirelessly behind the scenes, from the groundskeepers maintaining the pristine greens to the referees and officials ensuring fair play and integrity.</p>
              <p>To camera men (and ladies) capturing precious moments to the engineers who ensure that all course equipment works. We offer resources and opportunities to enhance their skills to pursue their dreams on the course and recognise and celebrate the diverse contributions of every participant on the golf course.</p>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-lg-6">
            <div class="content-right">
              <h2>Off the Course</h2>
              <p>The Africa Golf Foundation is dedicated to providing comprehensive support to the growth of the sport in Africa by supporting all individuals who play a vital role in the world of golf including off the course. From fitness coaches and dieticians who optimise the player's health, to the psychologists who nurture their mental fortitude and well-being and the administrators who ensure the smooth operation of golfing events.</p>
              <p> We are here to champion their efforts and elevate their impact. We recognise that success in golf requires a holistic approach , encompassing physical, mental and organisational support. By providing comprehensive support to off-course participants, we contribute to the overall health, professionalism and sustainability of the golf community.</p>

            <h2>Golf Facilities</h2>
            <p>The Africa Golf Foundation is dedicated to enhancing golf facilities  across Africa, ensuring that players of all levels have access to  world-class venues and resources to hone their sills and passion for the  game. Our commitment extends to supporting a wide range of facilities,  including golf clubs and golf courses, driving ranges, golf academies  and research facilities , with the goal of fostering excellence,  inclusivity and growth.</p>
            <p>An investment in golf facilities is an investment in the future of the  game. By supporting investment in facilities, we are creating a vibrant  and sustainable golfing ecosystem that benefits players, communities and  the sport as a whole.             We are also dedicated to working to control global warming  through partnerships with golf courses to promote sustainable methods as  well as conservation initiatives. Our golf courses could be our last  nature reserves and they must be maintained.</p>

          <div class="content-right" >
            <h2>Committed to Education</h2>
            <p>We believe that enhancing skills should be complimented by education  providing participants with the knowledge and tools that they require to  navigate the world and pursue their dreams with confidence. We  recognise that education is the foundation of success in any endeavour,  and we are dedicated to ensuring that participants have access to  quality education and opportunities for lifelong learning. Our  educational support initiatives encompass a range of programs designed  to empower individuals at every stage of their educational journey.</p>
            <p> For students in school, we offer educational scholarships to alleviate  financial barriers and provide access to quality education. These  scholarships enable students to pursue their passion for golf alongside  their studies.              Furthermore, we provide guidance and resources to help  participants access higher education whether through college  scholarships, vocational training programs or pathways to continued  learning.</p>

            <h2>Community Outreach</h2>
            <p>We will bring the transformative power of golf to every corner of Africa  through innovative outreach programs. We will visit schools and  communities with limited awareness of golf to raise awareness of golf  and to showcase the abundance of opportunities it offers, especially for  members of marginalised communities.</p>
            <p>Africa Golf Foundation will also engage workshops and exciting events to  ignite a passion for golf opening doors to new possibilities and  careers in the sport and paving the way for inclusivity and opportunity  in the world of golf.             Part of our outreach is dedicated to promoting conservation  and sustainability and our methods, literature and equipment will  reflect this.</p>
